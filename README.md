# odin-recipes

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum and aims to help learners practice foundational HTML skills by building a basic recipe website.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to create a simple static website featuring an index page with links to individual recipe pages. The focus is on structuring semantic HTML elements and establishing the fundamental workflow for web development projects.

- **Homepage (index.html)**: Contains navigation links to multiple recipe pages.
- **Recipe pages**: Each recipe page includes the name, ingredients, and preparation steps of a dish.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Structuring web content using semantic HTML elements.
- Organizing a project directory for web development.
- Linking between pages using anchor tags (`<a>`).
- Practicing clean and readable code formatting.
- Using version control (Git) for project management.
